    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Basbousa, an Egyptian semolina cake with yogurt is one of the best Egyptian desserts that comes out fairly quick</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>farina</li>
        <li>yogurt</li>
        <li>honey</li>
        <li>baking powder</li>
        <li>sugar</li>
        <li>shredded cocount</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a deep bowl, add farina, sugar, baking powder and coconut flakes if using. Mixing everything well.</li>
        <li>Melt ghee and dissolve honey in it. Pour ghee over the dry ingredients and mix well with a spoon until you feel that all farina granules have been well covered with ghee mixture. You'll end up with a well-wet sandy textured mixture. </li>
        <li>Now add the yogurt to the mix.</li>
        <li>Mix just enough until it disappears in the mixture. Do Not Overmix, if you are afraid you might overmix the ingredients, use your hands.</li>
        <li>Brush the baking sheet/pan with tahini and ghee. This is a tip I've got from many cooks, I used to brush mine with melted butter though. Dump in your baasbousa mix.</li>
        <li>Spread the farina mixture evenly on the pan pressing down with your fingers.</li>
        
    </ol>
